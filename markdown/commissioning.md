Commissioning
=============

Dr Peter Cox has over 30 years of experience in the design, manufacture and commissioning of polymer processing equipment.  Dr Cox has also carried out many troulble shoooting visits to sites to advise corrections to processing condititons or diehead/machinery geometry.

Locations have been in laboratories and manufacturing plants in the UK, Europe and the USA and projects have included large bore rubber oil hoses, the innovative multilayer OPP process for clear plastic jars and many associated with consumer packaging.

Knowledge of screw design, polymer flow analysis and the processing properties of a wide range of polymers gives a background that will help solve problems.
